## Current and Future Development ðŸŒ±
- Currently working towards getting my [IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering)
- Another course I'm enrolled in is the [Programming Basics with Java by SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/)
- And last, but not least the [Cloud Essentials Learning Plan by AWS](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/82/cloud-essentials-learning-plan)

- After I'm done with those, I'm interested in progressing my skills using Linux, MySQL and further expanding my knowledge in Python and C#
