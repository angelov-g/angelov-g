## Current and Future Development ðŸŒ±
- Currently taking part in the [IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering).
- Another course I'm enrolled in is the [Programming Basics with Java by SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/)
- And last, but not least the [Cloud Essentials Learning Plan by AWS](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/82/cloud-essentials-learning-plan)

- After I'm done with those, I'm interested in progressing my skills using Linux, MySQL and further expanding my knowledge in Python and C#

## About me
  Born and raised by the sea in a small town called Balchik. I was sent to study in Varna during my high-school years and eventually left Bulgaria to go and receive my Master's Degree in Aston University (UK).
